# Bootstrap
Places that store instructions about your dotfiles, this is where the magic happens:
- `packageslist`: Package list
- `setup`: Setup script

It is recommended to pre-download `bawkpack` so that you don't have to install` curl` before bootstrap:

```sh
cd path/to/bootstrap
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NNBnh/bawkpack/master/bawkpack > bawkpack
chmod +x bawkpack
```
